"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon"
					 (Neil Diamond)

[Intro:]

Gm         C            F      Gm
	 [Bb A G   single notes]
Girl,       you'll be a woman soon

[Verse 1:]

Gm 
Love you so much can't count all the ways
I'd die for you girl and all they can say is
F 
  He's not your kind
	 Gm 
They never get tired of putting me down and 
I never know when I come around
F 
  What I'm gonna find
			   Eb
Don't let them make up your mind, don't you know

[Chorus:]

Gm    C              F     Gm
Girl,   you'll be a woman soon
Gm    C               F
Please  come take my hand
Gm    C              F     Gm
Girl,   you'll be a woman soon
Gm    C                F
Soon,   you'll need a man

[Verse 2:]

I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife
The boy's no good
I finally found what I've been lookin' for
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby I've done all I could, it's up to you

[repeat chorus]
