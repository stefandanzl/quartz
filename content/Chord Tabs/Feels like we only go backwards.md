[Chorus]
 
                G       D          C
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
              G       D   C
Every part of me says go ahead 
                   G        D   C
I got my hopes up again, oh no not again 
              G       D        C
Feels like we only go backwards darlin' 
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                                                      D
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
                                   Em
But I hear it inside my head all day
                                                      A
when I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
                    Am
Your feelings don't show
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                G       D          C
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
              G       D   C
Every part of me says go ahead 
                   G        D   C
I got my hopes up again, oh no not again 
              G       D        C
Feels like we only go backwards darlin' 
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                                     D
The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
                     Em
Cause I decided long ago
 
but that's the way it seems to go when trying so hard to
                  A
get to something real
 
   Am
It feels 
 
 
[Outro]
 
                G       D          C
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
              G       D   C
Every part of me says go ahead 
                   G        D   C
I got my hopes up again, oh no not again 
              G       D        C           C         G
Feels like we only go backwards baby
