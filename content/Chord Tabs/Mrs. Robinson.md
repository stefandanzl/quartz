[Verse 1]
E                                                E7
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
A                                    A7
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
D               G               C     G/B   Am
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
E                           D
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

[Verse 2]
E                                             E7
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
A                                A7
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
D             G               C    G/B     Am
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair
E                         D
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids
 
[Chorus]
D            G        Em

[Verse 3]
E                                 E7
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
A                               A7
Going to the candidates debate
D              G              C           G/B     Am
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
E                          D
Any way you look at it you lose
 
[Chorus]
D              G          Em
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
G                  Em             C    C/B Am7 Am7/G            D
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you,                woo woo woo 
D               G        Em
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
G               Em            C    C/B Am7 Am7/G          Am            E
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away,              hey hey hey, hey hey hey
