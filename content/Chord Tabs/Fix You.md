[Intro]
C  Em  Am7  G  x2
 
[Verse 1]
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you try your best but you don't succeed,
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you get what you want, but not what you need,
          C                  Em             Am7       G
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep,
           C   Em   Am7   G
Stuck in reverse.
 
[Verse 2]
          C                  Em           Am7        G
And the tears come streaming down your face,
          C                  Em           Am7        G
When you lose something you can't replace,
          C                 Em            Am7        G
When you love someone but it goes to waste,
             C    Em    Am7   G         F
Could it be worse?
 
[Chorus]
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G
And I will try to fix you,
 
[Instrumental]
C  Em  Am7  G  x2
 
[Verse 3]
  C                Em       Am7        G
High up above or down below,
             C              Em       Am7       G
When you're too in love to let it go,
             C              Em        Am7      G
But if you never try you'll never know,
                  C    Em   Am7   G       F
Just what you're worth.
 
[Chorus]
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G
And I will try to fix you.
 
[Instrumental]
C  F  C  G
Am F  C  G
C  F  C  G
Am F  C  G
 
[Bridge]
C            F
Tears stream, down your face,
C                       G
When you lose something you cannot replace.
Am7          F                  C   G
Tears stream, down your face and I (hold).
C            F
Tears stream, down your face,
C                    Em
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes.
Am7          F                  C   G
Tears stream, down your face and I (hold).
 
[Chorus] (single strumming)
F       C    G           F
Lights will guide you home,
F   C  G            F
And ignite your bones,
F      C   G               C
And I will try to fix you.
