[Intro]
G   Em   Am7   D   x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
       G                               B7
That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say
Em7                              A7
    You're ridin' high in April,    shot down in May
    G                B7          Em7
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
     A7                              D13
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
 
 
[Verse 2]
              G                          B7
I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
Em7                            A7
   Some people get their kicks    stompin' on a dream
G/D                   B7               Em
   But I don't let it,   let it get me down
            A7             C/D                    G     C/G  G
'Cause this fine old world,    it keeps spinnin' around
 
 
[Bridge]
            G7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
          C6
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
     A7
Each time I find myself flat on my face
  D           D          D           D  C/D
I pick myself up and get back in the race
 
 
[Verse 3]
       G                              B7
That's life (that's life), I tell you   I can't deny it
Em7                             A7
   I thought of quittin', baby,   but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
    G/D                      B7               Em7
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
    A7                       C/D              G   C/G  G
I'd jump right on a big bird     and then I'd fly
 
 
[Bridge]
            G7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
          C6
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
     A7
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
       D           D          Eb
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
 
 
[Verse 4]
       Ab                              C7
That's life (that's life), that's life    and I can't deny it
Fm                                  Bb7
    Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
    Ab/Eb              C7                     Fm   Bb7 ......
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
          Bb7                 Db/Eb          Ab         B7         E7          Db/Eb
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die
                                             doot doot  doot doot  doot doot
A7b5       Ab7
My ....    my!
