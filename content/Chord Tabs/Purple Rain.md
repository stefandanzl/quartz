    I never meant to cause you any sorrow

    I only want one time to see you laughing
  D                                           G N.C.
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
                     G       Em
Purple rain, purple rain
                     D
Purple rain, purple rain
                                             G N.C.
I only want to see you bathing in the Purple Rain
 
[Verse 2]
                                   G       Em
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
D                                     C
   I only wanted to be some kind of friend
G                                      Em
   Baby I could never steal you from another
D                                          G N.C.
   It's such a shame our friendship had to end
 
[Chorus]
                     C
Purple rain, purple rain
                     G       Em
Purple rain, purple rain
                     D
Purple rain, purple rain
                                             G N.C.
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain
 
[Verse 3]
                                       G       Em
Honey I know I know I know times are changin'
D                                              C
   It's time we all reach out for somethin' new
 
That means you too
G
   You say you want a leader
Em
   But you can't seem to make up your mind
                          D
I think you better close it
                                       G N.C.
and let me guide you to the purple rain
 
[Chorus]
                     C
Purple rain, purple rain
                    G
Purple rain, purple rain (Whew)
 
if you know what I'm singin' about
            Em
help me and come on raise your hand
                     D
Purple rain, purple rain
 
I only want to see you, only want to see you
                  G    N.C.
In the purple rain

G    Em    D    C
