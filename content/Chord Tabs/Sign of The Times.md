[Intro]
F Dm C
 
[Verse 1]
F 
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
               C
Welcome to the final show
 
Hope you’re wearing your best clothes
F 
You can't bribe the door
                   Dm
On your way to the sky
                C
You look pretty good down here
 
But you ain't really good...
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F
If we never learn we've been here before
Dm
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
F 
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
[Chorus]
F 
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
              C
We gotta get away from here
              C7
We gotta get away from here
F 
Just stop your crying
            Dm
It’ll be alright
                      C
They told me that the end is near
              C7
We gotta get away from here
 
[Verse 2]
F 
Just stop your crying
                      Dm
Have the time of your life
                     C
Breakin' through the atmosphere
 
Things look pretty good from here
 
F                             Dm
Remember everything will be alright
               C
We could meet again somewhere.
 
Somewhere far away from here.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F 
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm 
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
F 
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm 
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
[Chorus]
F
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
             C
We gotta get away from here
 
We gotta get away from here
F 
Stop your crying, baby
            Dm
It’ll be alright
                      C
They told me that the end is near
              C7
We gotta get away from here
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F 
If we never learn we've been here before
Dm
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
F 
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm 
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
 
[Bridge]
F 
 We don't talk enough
Dm 
  We should open up
C                        Bb
 Before it's all too much
F 
 Will we ever learn
Dm 
 We've been here before
C                       Bb
 It's just what we know
 
[Ending]

Stop your crying, baby
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
             C
We gotta get away
               Bb
We got to get away
               F
We got to get away
               Dm
We got to get away
               C
We got to get away
 
We got to! We got to!
F 
Away!
 
We got to! We got to!
Dm 
Away!
 
We got to! We got to!
C       Bb
Awwwwaaaaaaay!
