[Intro]
| Am    | F     | Am    | F     | x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
 Am
Psychic spies from China
       F
Try to steal your mind's elation
Am 
Little girls from Sweden
         F
Dream of silver screen quotations
    C                 G
And if you want these kind of dreams
     F        Dm
It's Californication
 
 
[Interlude]
| Am    | F     | Am    | F     |
 
 
[Verse 2]
        Am
It's the edge of the world
           F
And all of western civilization
    Am
The sun may rise in the East
            F
At least it settled in a final location
     C               G
It's understood that Hollywood
      F        Dm
sells Californication
 
 
[Interlude]
| Am    | Fmaj7 | Am    | Fmaj7 |
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 Am
Pay your surgeon very well
   Fmaj7
To break the spell of aging
  Am
Celebrity skin, is this your chin?
   Fmaj7
Or is that war you're waging?
Am                Fmaj7
   First born unicorn
Am                Fmaj7
   Hardcore soft porn

[Verse 3]
 Am
Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
      F
Be my very own constellation
  Am
A teenage bride with a baby inside
        F
Getting high on information
    C                    G
And buy me a star on the boulevard
     F        Dm
It's Californication
 
 
[Interlude]
| Am    | F     | Am    | F     |
 
 
[Verse 4]
 Am
Space may be the final frontier
         F
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
    Am
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
        F
Singing songs off station to station?
    C              G
And Alderaan's not far away
     F        Dm
It's Californication
 
 
[Interlude]
| Am    | Fmaj7 | Am    | Fmaj7 |
  Ooooo - ooooh   Oooo -  ooooh
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am
Born and raised by those who praise
   Fmaj7
Control of population
 Am
Everybody's been there and
   Fmaj7
I don't mean on vacation
Am                Fmaj7
   First born unicorn
Am                Fmaj7
   Hardcore soft porn

[Verse 5]
   Am
Destruction leads to a very rough road
       F
But it also breeds creation
    Am
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
        F
They're just another good vibration
    C                    G
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
     F        Dm
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
   Fmaj7
To break the spell of aging
 Am
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
    Fmaj7
But this is what you're craving
Am                Fmaj7
   First born unicorn
Am                Fmaj7
   Hardcore soft porn
