```chords

[Verse 1]
E
I sit and wait
                     A            C#m  B
Does an angel contemplate my fate
            E
And do they know
 
The places where we go
                     A   C#m B
When we're grey and old
               F#m
'Cos I've been told
           A               C#m7          A
That salvation lets their wings unfold
            D
So when I'm lying in my bed
         A/C#
Thoughts running through my head
      E                       D
And I feel that love is dead
           A/C#        E
I'm loving angels instead
 
[Chorus]
                 B                     C#m
And through it all she offers me protection
                    A
A lot of love and affection
                     E
Whether I'm right or wrong
                   B
And down the waterfall
                 C#m
Wherever it may take me
                       A
I know that life won't break me
                E/G#             F#m      D
When I come to call she won't forsake me
           A/C#            E
I'm loving angels instead
 
[Verse 2]
E
When I'm feeling weak
                          A             C#m B
And my pain walks down a one way street
         E
I look above
                          A                C#m  B
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
     D
And as the feeling grows
              A/C#
She breathes flesh to my bones
     E                 D
And when love is dead
           A/C#       E
I'm loving angels instead
 
[Chorus]
               B                   C#m
And through it all she offers me protection
                    A
A lot of love and affection
                     E
Whether I'm right or wrong
                   B
And down the waterfall
                 C#m
Wherever it may take me
                       A
I know that life won't break me
                E/G#             F#m       D
When I come to call she won't forsake me
           A/C#       E
I'm loving angels instead
 
[Solo]
Bm  A  E  E  x4
 
[Chorus]
              B                   C#m
And through it all she offers me protection
                    A
A lot of love and affection
                     E
Whether I'm right or wrong
                   B
And down the waterfall
                 C#m
Wherever it may take me
                       A
I know that life won't break me
                E/G#             F#m       D
When I come to call she won't forsake me
           A/C#       E
I'm loving angels instead
