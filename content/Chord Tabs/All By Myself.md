All By Myself chords
Eric Carmen (Rachmaninoff) *
 
[Verse 1]
 
 A 
When I was young
        Dm        A   Em
I never needed anyone
           F#                Bm   Dm
And makin' love was just for fun
               A   Dm E7
Those days are gone
 
[Verse 2]
 
A 
Livin' alone
           Dm                   A     Em
I think of all the friends I've known
           F#           Bm    Dm
But when I dial the telephone
         A   Dm E7
Nobody's home
 
[Refrain]
 
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore
 
[Verse 3]
 
A 
Hard to be sure
            Dm          A    Em
Sometimes I feel so insecure
            F#             Bm   Dm
And love so distant and obscure
            A   Dm E7
Remains the cure
 
[Refrain]
 
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore
 
[Verse 4]
 
A 
When I was young
        Dm        A   Em
I never needed anyone
           F#                Bm   Dm
And makin' love was just for fun
               A   Dm E7
Those days are gone
 
[Refrain]
 
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore

All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore
 
A        C#m
All by myself
               Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna be, all by myself anymore
A        C#m
All by myself
                 Em   F#   Bm      Dm  E
Don't wanna live, all by myself anymore
