```chords
[Verse 1]
             C
Sleigh bells ring are you listening?
       G7
In the lane snow is glistening
  G         F
A beautiful sight        
      Em      Dm
We're happy tonight      
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
[Verse  2]
      C
Gone away is the bluebird
        G7
Here to stay is a new bird
   G            F
He sings a love song
   Em     Dm
As we go along   
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
[Chorus]
E             A              E
In the meadow we can build a snowman
E                 A            E
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
G                   C
He'll say: "Are you married"?
            G
We'll say: "No man"!
    G              D7
But you can do the job
               G   G7
When you're in town
 
[Verse 3]
      C
Later on we'll conspire
      G7
As we dream by the fire
   G       F
To face unafraid         
    Em               Dm
The plans that we've made
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
[Chorus]
E             A              E
In the meadow we can build a snowman
E                A             E
And pretend that he's a circus clown
G                  C               G
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
   G            D7                G   G7
Until the other kiddies knock him down
 
[Verse 4]
        C
When it snows ain't it thrilling
            G7
Though your nose gets a chilling         
      G          F        Em     Dm
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
Am           G7           C
Walking in a winter wonderland
