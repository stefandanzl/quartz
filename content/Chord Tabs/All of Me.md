John Legend - All of Me
 
[Intro]
Em   C   G   D   x2
 
[Verse]
Em           C                       G
What would I do without your smart mouth
            D                     Em
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
          C            G             D            Em
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
             C                     G
What's going on in that beautiful mind
               D             Em
I'm on your magical mystery ride
         C              G                       D        Am
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
 
[Pre-chorus]
   Am            G
My head's under water
    D              Am
But I'm breathing fine
 Am              G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
 
[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Em
Loves all of you
            Am
Love your curves and all your edges
         C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Em
I'll give my all to you
          Am
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
 
[Verse]
Em        C                       G
How many times do I have to tell you
                  D                      Em
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
              C           G          D                  Em
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
             C                G
You're my downfall, you're my muse
             D                        Em
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                C             G        D            Am
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
 
[Pre-chorus]
   Am            G
My head's under water
    D              Am
But I'm breathing fine
 Am              G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
 
[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Em
Loves all of you
            Am
Love your curves and all your edges
          C/D       D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Em
I'll give my all to you
          Am
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
 
[Bridge]
                Am
Give me all of you, oh
Am            G
Cards on the table
       D            Am
We're both showing hearts
Am          G                D
Risking it all, though it's hard
 
[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Em
Loves all of you
            Am
Love your curves and all your edges
         C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Em
I'll give my all to you
          Am
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you
                 Em   C      G    D
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
