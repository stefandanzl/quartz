[Intro]
 
Em  E7sus4  Cmaj7  Em Bm
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em              E7sus4
We can remember swimming in December,
Cmaj7                        Em   Bm
Heading for the city lights, in 1975
Em 
We share in each other
E7sus4 
Nearer than father
Cmaj7                 Em              Bm
The scent of a lemon, drips from your eyes
 
Em 
We are the people that rule the world
Bm 
A force running in every boy and girl
C 
All rejoicing in the world
Em 
Take me now
Bm 
We can try
 
Em 
We lived an adventure
E7sus4 
Love in the Summer
Cmaj7 
Followed the sun till night
Em          Bm             Em
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
E7sus4 
The feeling was stronger
Cmaj7 
The shock hit eleven
Em               Bm
Got lost in your eyes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C                    Em                                 D
I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me, but I know I try
              C
Are you gonna leave me now
Em           A/D
Can’t you be believing now
(repeat)
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em 
Can you remember and humanize,
E7sus4 
It was still where we’d energized,
Cmaj7                         Em        Bm
Lie in the sand and visualize like its 75 again
 
Em 
We are the people that rule the world
Bm 
A force running in every boy and girl
C 
All rejoicing in the world
Em 
Take me now
Bm 
We can try 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                      Em                                 D
I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me, but I know I try
              C
Are you gonna leave me now
Em           A/D
Can’t you be believing now
(repeat)
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em 
I know everything about you
Bm 
You know everything about me
C                     Em
Know everything about us
(repeat)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                      Em                                 D
I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me, but I know I try
              C
Are you gonna leave me now
Em             A/D
Can’t you be believing now
(repeat)
