[Intro]
Em  B

[Verse 1]
Em                       B
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Em                      B
  No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
Em  D       G          D          Em
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Em  D       G       D       A               B
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.
 
[Verse 2]
Em                         B
  I see a line of cars and they're all painted black.
Em                              B
  With flowers and my love both never to come back.
Em  D          G          D         Em
  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Em       D       G    D       A             B
  Like a newborn baby it just happens every day.
 
[Verse 3]
Em                         B
  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
Em                          B
  I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Em      D         G     D       Em
  Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts.
Em         D    G      D       A                   B
  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.
 
[Verse 4]
Em                             B
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.
Em                              B
  I could not forsee this thing happening to you.
Em   D      G      D      Em
  If I look hard enough into the setting sun
Em   D         G          D     A                B
  My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.
 
[Verse 5]
Em                       B
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Em                      B
  No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
Em  D       G          D          Em
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Em  D       G       D       A               B
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

Em  B
 
               Em                      B
I wanna see it painted, painted black, black as night, black as coal
  Em                        B
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
               Em                                 B
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah
