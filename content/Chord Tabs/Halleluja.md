[Verse 1]
         G                   Em
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
     G                      Em
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    C                D                   G    D
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   G                  C           D
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Em              C
The minor fall, the major lift
    D               B7          Em
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 
[Verse 2]
     G                         Em
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
    G               Em
You saw her bathing on the roof
    C              D             G        D
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    G             C       D
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Em                         C
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    D                  B7            Em
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 
[Verse 3]
    G              Em
You say I took the name in vain
G            Em
I don't even know the name
    C              D                 G      D
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          G                 C     D
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Em             C
It doesn't matter which you heard
    D           B7          Em
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 
[Verse 4]
  G               Em
I did my best, it wasn't much
  G                   Em
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     C                 D                    G   D
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    G              C        D
And even though it all went wrong
     Em               C
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     D             B7              Em
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
[Outro]
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
