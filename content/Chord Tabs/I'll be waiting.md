He broke your heart
   A            C#m
He took your soul
    D          A
You hurt inside
     E            C#m
cause there’s a hole
   D          A
You need sometime
  A      C#m
to be alone

Then you will find

what you’ve always known

into the night
   D           A
I feel your pain
      E            C#m
can I make it right
   D        A
I realize
  A                   C#m
there’s no end in sight
     D            A
Yet, still I wait

for you to see the light

Whenever you need me
 A     E
I’ll be there

That makes me feel this way
        Bm         D
Girl, you are my own
      C#m
I wane be with you
  Bm
until we’re old

Because the love you need is right in front of you
 
please come home
