[Intro]
 
Em G
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Em                  G
    Here I go out to  sea again
                      Em
The sunshine fills my  hair
                       G
and dreams hang in the air
Em                          G
   Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
                     Em
You know it feels unfair
                    G
There's magic everywhere
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em               Am
   Look at me standing
Em                  Am
   Here on my own again
Em                     G         G   Am
   Up straight in the sunshine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em       G
No need to run and hide
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
           Em        G
No need to laugh and cry
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em
   The sun's in your eyes,
             G
the heat is in your hair
                      Em
They seem to hate you
                G
Because you're there
   Em                       G
And I need a friend, oh I need a friend
                Em
to make me happy
                       G
Not stand there on my own
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em               Am
   Look at me standing
Em                  Am
   Here on my own again
Em                     G         G   Am
   Up straight in the sunshine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em       G
No need to run and hide
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
           Em        G
No need to laugh and cry
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em                     G
I need a friend, oh I need a friend
                Em
to make me happy
         G
Not so alone
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em               Am
   Look at me here
Em                  Am
   Here on my own again
Em                     G         G   Am
   Up straight in the sunshine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em       G
No need to run and hide
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
           Em        G
No need to laugh and cry
        Em          Am       D
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
