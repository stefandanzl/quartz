[Intro]
A    F#m   D  E  A
 
[Verse 1]
             A
When the night has come
F#m
  And the land is dark
            D         E                 A
And the moon is the only light we'll see
          A
No, I won't be afraid,
      F#m
No, I won't be afraid
            D            E             A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.
 
[Chorus]
                      A
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    F#m
Oh, stand by me.
    D     E            A
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.
 
[Verse 2]
         A
If the sky that we look upon
F#m
Should tumble and fall
            D         E                 A
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea,
          A
I won't cry, I won't cry,
      F#m
No, I won't shed a tear
            D            E             A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.
 
[Chorus]
                      A
And darling, darling, stand by me,
    F#m
Oh, stand by me.
     D        E            A
Oh, stand now, stand by me,
Stand by me.
 
[Instrumental]
A    F#m   D  E  A    x2
 
[Chorus]
                      A
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    F#m
Oh, stand by me.
     D               E
Oh, stand now, stand by me,
      A
Stand by me.
 
                                     A                 F#m
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh, stand by me
     D              E             A
Oh, stand now, oh, stand, stand by me
