[Verse 1]
F   G     C          Am
Put on my blue suede shoes,
    F       G      C     Am
And I board-ed the plane. 
        F       G           C         Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues, 
F                G           C     Am
In the middle of the pouring rain.
F   G     C   Am    F        G    C       Am
W.__C. Handy, won't you look down over me, 
F          G       C            Am
Yeah I got a first class ticket. 
           F         G       C
But I'm as blue as a boy can be. 
 
 
[Chorus 1]
         Am         F       G  C
Then I'm walking in Memphis, 
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. 
Am             F    G  C
Walking in Mem—phis, 
Am              F        G           G7sus4 C/G
But do I really feel the way I feel? 
 
 
[Verse 2]
G7sus4              C/G
Saw the ghost of El—vis, 
G7sus4       C/G
On Union Ave—nue.
                G7sus4                C/G
Followed him up to the gates of Grace—land, 
       G7sus4                         C/G
Then I watched him walk right through. 
       F2                  G7sus4  C
Now se—curity they did not see him, 
Am        F2      G7sus4 C
They just hovered 'round his tomb. 
Am            F2            G7sus4
But there's a pretty little thing, 
     C       Am
Wait—ing for the King. 
F           N.C.
Down in the Jungle Room,
 
 
[Chorus 2]
C                         F    G C
When I was walking in Mem—phis, 
Am                    F        G           C
I was Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. 
Am             F    G C
Walking in Mem—phis 
Am              F        G          C7sus4
But do I really feel the way I feel?

            C7sus4         C7     C7sus4 C7
They've got catfish on the table 
            C7sus4        C7    C7sus4 C7
They've got gospel in the air 
                     E7         F7
And Reverend Green__ be glad to see you 
         F#dim7        G7     C/G G7
When you haven't got a prayer 
N.C.                               F    G C
But boy you've got a prayer in Mem—phis 
 
 
[Verse 3]
F           G     C     Am
Now, Muriel plays piano 
      F         G         C    Am
Every Friday at the Holly-wood 
F        G                  C   Am
And they brought me down to see her 
F                 G    C     Am
And they asked me if I would
F2   G7sus4 C       Am7
Do a little num-ber 
      F         G      C     Am7
And I sang with all my might
               F2          G     C         Am7
And she said, "Tell me are you a Christian child?" 
            F2  N.C.      C
And I said,"Ma'am I am to-night"
 
 
[Chorus 3]
Am             F   G C
Walking in Mem—phis,  (Walking in Memphis) 
Am                    F        G           C
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale.  (Walk, walk, walk)  
Am             F    G C
Walking in Mem—phis,   (Walking in Memphis)  
Am              F        C   Dm C
But do I really feel the way I  feel?  (Walk, walk, walk) 
Am             F    G C
Walking in Mem—phis,   (Walking in Memphis)   
Am                    F        G           C
I was Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. (Walk, walk, walk)   
Am              F        G      Csus4
But do I really feel the way I  feel?

[Outro]
F   G     C          Am
Put on my blue suede shoes,
      F    G            C Am
And I boarded the plane. 
        F       G           C         Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues, 
F                    G       C    Am
In the middle of the pouring rain.
        F       G           C         Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues, 
       F                  G   F
In the middle of the pour—ing rain.
