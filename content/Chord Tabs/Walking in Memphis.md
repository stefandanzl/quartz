```chords

[Verse 1]
 
F   G     C          Am
Put on my blue suede shoes
      F    G      C    Am
And I boarded the plane
F                   G           C     Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
F                    G       C   Am
In the middle of the pouring rain
F G  C     Am F                   G    C Am
W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me
F            G       C         Am
Yeah I got a first class ticket
           F         G       C
But I'm as blue as a boy can be
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Am         F      G         C
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Am         F             G           C
Walking in Memphis
Am              F              G     Csus4
But do I really feel the way I feel?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F       G        C    Am
Saw the ghost of Elvis
F  G     C  Am
On Union Avenue
F            G         C        Am
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
       F           G          C      Am
Then I watched him walk right through
      F           G       C      Am
Now security they did not see him
          F        G         C   Am
They just hovered 'round his tomb
              F             G      C               Am
But there's a pretty little thing, Waiting for the King
N.C.
Down in the Jungle Room
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Am         F      G         C
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Am         F             G           C
Walking in Memphis
Am              F              G     Csus4
But do I really feel the way I feel?
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
C7sus4 / C7 / C7sus4 / C7
 
 
[Bridge]
 
            C7sus4         C7     C7sus4 C7
They've got catfish on the table
            C7sus4        C7      C7sus4 C7
They've got gospel in the air
                   E7         F7
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
         F#dim7         G7        C/G   C
When you haven't got a prayer
N.C.                           F       G  C  Am
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
F          G     C    Am
Now Muriel plays piano
F     G             C    Am
Every Friday at the Hollywood
F        G                  C      Am
And they brought me down to see her
F        G             C    Am
And they asked me if I would
F    G      C     Am
Do a little number
      F         G      C    Am
And I sang with all my might
               F           G     C         Am
And she said, "Tell me are you a Christian child?"
N.C.
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight"
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Am         F      G         C
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Am         F             G           C
Walking in Memphis
Am              F              G
But do I really feel the way I feel? 
 
C        Am         F      G         C
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Am              F        G           C
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Am         F             G           C
Walking in Memphis
Am              F              G
But do I really feel the way I feel? 
 
 
[Ending]
 
F   G     C          Am
Put on my blue suede shoes
      F    G      C    Am
And I boarded the plane
F                   G           C     Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
F                    G       C   Am
In the middle of the pouring rain
F                   G           C     Am
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
F                    G       C   Am
In the middle of the pouring rain
