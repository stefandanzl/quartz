[Intro]
 
| Am  D    | x4
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am         D   Am             D
Feeling better now that we're through
Am         D          Am        D
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
  F          G          C           C B Bb
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Am    D           E      E7
Now I see how you really are
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          Am                  D                Am           D        Am    D
You're no good     You're no good   You're no good  Baby, you're no good
           Am     D
I'm gonna say it again
          Am              D                Am            D        Am  D    Am  D
You're no good  You're no good   You're no good  Baby, you're no good
 
 
[Verse]
 
    Am      D           Am         D
I broke a heart that's gentle and true
       Am       D          Am           D
Well I broke a heart over someone like you
     F          G          C          C B Bb
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
Am         D               E       E7
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am               D                Am          D        Am    D
You're no good   You're no good   You're no good  Baby, you're no good
          Am      D
I'm gonna say it again
           Am              D              Am           D         Am
You're no good  You're no good You're no good   Baby, you're no good
