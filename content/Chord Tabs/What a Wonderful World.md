[Verse 1]
 
       C        Em     F         Em
I see trees of green, red roses too
Dm         C       E7         Am
I see them bloom, for me and you
      Ab            Dm7        G          C     G
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
 
[Verse 2]
 
      C        Em        F         Em
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
Dm                 C        E7           Am
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
      Ab            Dm7        G          C
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
 
[Bridge]
 
    G                         C
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
G                       C
Are also on the faces of people going by
        Am             Em          Am         Em
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
F             Em    Dm   C   G
Theyâ€™re really saying I love you
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
       C      Em        F           Em
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
Dm              C             E7        Am
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
      Ab              Dm7     G           C    Bb7   A7
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
      Fmaj7           Dm7      G          C
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world
