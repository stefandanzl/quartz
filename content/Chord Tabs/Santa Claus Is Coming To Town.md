```chords
    G
You better watch out
    C
You better not cry
    G
You better not pout
    C
I'm telling you why
G      Em         Am7   D7  G
Santa Claus is coming to town
 
     G
He's making a list,
     C
And checking it twice;
G                    C
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice.
G      Em         Am7   D7  G
Santa Claus is coming to town
 
   G7                   C
He sees you when you're sleeping
   G7                 C
He knows when you're awake
   A7                   D
He knows if you've been bad or good
      A7                 D
So be good for goodness sake
 
    G
You better watch out
    C
You better not cry
    G
You better not pout
    C
I'm telling you why
G      Em         Am7   D7  G
Santa Claus is coming to town
 
G      Em         Am7   D7  G
Santa Claus is coming to town
