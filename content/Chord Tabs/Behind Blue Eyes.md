The Who - Behind Blue Eyes
 
Here's my version of the Who's "Behind Blue Eyes" for acoustic guitar.
I like to use sus chords in place of many major and minor chords
because it leaves the voicings open to interpretation - however,
you can replace my sus chords with either major or minor chords, you'll
just need to see which works best for you (the original Who version has
dedicated major or minor chords) - it's a great song, so have fun.

[Intro]
 
Esus4
(arpeggiated)
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to be the bad man
             Cadd9
to be the sad man
   Asus2
behind blue eyes
 
Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to be hated
             Cadd9
to be fated
   Asus2
to telling only lies
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C     D
But my dreams
              G
they aren't as empty
        C         D         E
as my conscience seems to be
          Bsus2          C
I have hours, only lonely
                D
my love is vengeance
               Asus2
that's never free
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like
            D  Dsus4
to feel these feelings
             Cadd9
like I do
   Asus2
and I blame you
 
 Em                       G
No one bites back as hard
            D  Dsus4
on their anger
             Cadd9
none of my pain and woe
   Asus2
can show through
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C     D
But my dreams
              G
they aren't as empty
        C         D         E
as my conscience seems to be
          Bsus2          C
I have hours, only lonely
                D
my love is vengeance
               Asus2
that's never free
 
 
[Bridge]
 
E   Bsus2   A
 
 E           Bsus2     A           E
When my fist clenches, crack it open
E        Bm         G        D
Before I use it and lose my cool
       Bsus2  A            D
When I smile, tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E  Bsus2 A
Before I laugh and act like a fool
E        Bsus2   A        E
And if I swallow anything evil
E        Bm     G       D
Put your finger down my throat
         Bsus2          A         D
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
        Bm           A         E Bsus2 A
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

[Verse]
 
 Em                       G
No one knows what it's like

to be the bad man
             Cadd9
to be the sad man
   Asus2
behind blue eyes
