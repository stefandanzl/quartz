[Verse 1]
 
Dm7             Gm7
I feel so unsure
     Bbmaj7                      Am7
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
Dm7
As the music dies
Gm7
Something in your eyes
Bbmaj7
Calls to mind a silver screen
    Am7
And all its sad goodbyes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm7 
I'm never gonna dance again
Gm7 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bbmaj7 
Though it's easy to pretend
  Am7 
I know you're not a fool
Dm7 
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
    Gm7
And waste the chance that I've been given
Bbmaj7 
So, I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you - oo - oo
 
Dm7   Gm7   Bbmaj7   Am7
  ohh oh
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Dm7            Gm7
Time can never mend
    Bbmaj7            Am7
The careless whispers of a good friend
 Dm7
To the heart and mind
 Gm7
Ignorance is kind
Bbmaj7
There's no comfort in the truth
Am7
Pain is all you'll find
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Dm7
I'm never gonna dance again
 Gm7
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
 Bbmaj7
Though it's easy to pretend
 Am7
I know you're not a fool
  Dm7
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
 Gm7
And waste the chance that I've been given
 Bbmaj7
So, I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you, ohh oh.
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Dm7   Gm7           Bbmaj7            Am7
           Never without your love
Dm7   Gm7           Bbmaj7            Am7
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 Dm7
Tonight, the music seems so loud
 Gm7
I wish that we could lose this crowd
 Bbmaj7
Maybe it's better this way
 Am7
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
 Dm7
We could have been so good together
 Gm7
We could have lived this dance forever
    Bbmaj7                     Am7
But now who's gonna dance with me?   Please stay
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Dm7
And I'm never gonna dance again
 Gm7
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
 Bbmaj7
Though it's easy to pretend
  Am7
I know you're not a fool
  Dm7
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
    Gm7
And waste the chance that I've been given
 Bbmaj7
So, I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you
 
 
[Outro]
 
Dm7   Gm7             Bbmaj7    Am7
      Oh ho
Dm7              Gm7                   Bbmaj7     Am7
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
Dm7               Gm7
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong?
   Bbmaj7                 Am7
so wrong, that you had to leave me alone?
 
 
Dm7          Gm7         Bbmaj7       Am7   x2
Do-waa ahh,  do-waa ahh, do-waa ahh,
 
Dm7   Gm7   Bbmaj7   Am7
(repeat to fade)
