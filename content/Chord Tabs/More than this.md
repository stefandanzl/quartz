```chords
[Intro]
 
D D7 D D7
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
        G           C
I could feel at the time
          Am        D
There was no way of knowing
       G             C
Fallen leaves in the night
        Am                D
Who can say where they're blowing
   G           C
As free as the wind
Am           D
   Hopefully learning
        G          C
Why the sea on the tide
    Am        D
Has no way of turning
 
 
[Chorus]
          G               C
More than this - there is nothing
          G               C
More than this - tell me one thing
          G               C
More than this - there is nothing
 
 
[Break]
 
D  C
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
       G         C
It was fun for a while
          Am        D
There was no way of knowing
       G            C
Like a dream in the night
        Am              D
Who can say where we're going
   G           C
No care in the world
Am           D
   Maybe I'm learning
        G          C
Why the sea on the tide
    Am        D
Has no way of turning
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          G               C
More than this - there is nothing
          G               C
More than this - tell me one thing
          G               C
More than this - there is nothing
 
 
[Outro]
 
          G      C
More than this - nothing
          G      C
More than this
          G      C
More than this - nothing
