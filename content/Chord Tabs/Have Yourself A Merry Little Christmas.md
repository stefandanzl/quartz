[Bridge]
Cmaj7       Cm6        Bm         Bbdim
      Once again as in olden days
      Am          D7      Gmaj7
Happy golden days      of yore
Em       F#7              Bm         E7
Faithful friends who were dear to us
        D7         A7       Am7   D7
Will be near to us    once more
 
 
[Verse 2]
G        Em7    Am7           D7
Someday soon we all will be together
G        Em7     Am7  D7
  If the Fates allow
G       Em7         Am7            B7          Em    G  G7
  Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
   Cmaj7           Am7          D7        G
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
