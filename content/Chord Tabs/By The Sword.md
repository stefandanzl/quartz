[Verse]
        Am
With the horses that you ride,
           D           F
And the feelings left inside,
         Am               F        G        Am
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind,
Am 
Well they claim they'd like to know,
          D                 F
and they wont could let you go
          Am          F          G      D
And the people gotta run for the last show
 
[Chorus]
                      F
Well there is all we want
                        Am
To live and die by the sword,
                         G
Well they tried to complicate you
                      D
But you left it all behind
                    F
All the worldly possessions
                  Am
Are left for recollections
                 G     E7   Am
And finally it's all gone
 
[Verse]
Am 
They're releasing all the hounds,
        D                 F
What is lost can still be found,
           Am                 F                G      Am
When you're walking with your fear down on the ground
Am 
Well there's those who choose to run
        D               F
Following the setting sun,
        Am              F      G      D
And now it seems the journey's has begun
 
[Chorus]
                      F
Well there is all we want
                        Am
To live and die by the sword,
                         G
Well they tried to complicate you
                      D
But you left it all behind
                    F
All the worldly possessions
                  Am
Are left for recollections
                 G     E7  Am
And finally it's all gone
 
[Bridge]
Am 
With the horses that you ride
        D               F
And the feelings left inside
        Am                  F       G   Dm
there's a time you need to leave it all behind
 
[Chorus]
                      F
Well there is all we want
                        Am
To live and die by the sword,
                         G
Well they tried to complicate you
                      D
But you left it all behind
                    F
All the worldly possessions
                  Am
Are left for recollections
                  G   E7  Am
And finally it's all gone
