Spend some time away
Cmaj7                 Am7
Getting ready for the day
              Bm7    Em  Em7
You're born again
Am7        Bm7
Spend some time alone
Cmaj7                      Am7
Understand that soon you'll run
            Bm7   Em  Em7
With better men alone again

It's within that brings that  
Am7       Bm7    Em  Em7
Lonely feeling
Am7    Bm7            Cmaj7
Understand when you leave here
 
You be clear
  Am7            Bm7  Em    Em7
Among the better men alone again

Alone again Alone
