[Intro]
Bb/A Fmaj7
Bb/A Fmaj7
 
 
[Verse 1]
Gm 
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low-ow-ow.
F 
 I lean back on my radio-o-o
C                            C7
 Some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll,
                     F  Ab Bb
'Lotta soul' he said.
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm 
 Then the loud sound did seem to fa-a-ade
F
 Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha-a-ase
C                            C7               A    G
 That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive.
 
 
[Chorus]
          F       Dm
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Am               Am7/G
He'd like to come and meet us
       C                   C7
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
          F       Dm
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Am             Am7/G
He's told us not to blow it
          C                 C7
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile,
 
He told me,
Bb          Bbm             F         D/F#
   "Let the children lose it, let the children use it,
Gm             C
   Let all the children boogie."
 
 
[Interlude]
Bb   F   C   F   Bb   F   C
 
 
[Verse 3]
Gm 
  Well I had to phone someone so I picked on you-ou-ou
F 
  Hey that's far out, so you heard him too-oo-oo
C                         C7                      F  Ab Bb
  Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel 2.
 
 
[Verse 4]
Gm 
  Look out your window I can see his li-i-ight,
F 
  If we can sparkle he may land toni-i-ight,
C                              C7                        A    G
 Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright.
 
 
[Chorus]
          F       Dm
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Am               Am7/G

       C                     C7
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
          F       Dm
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Am             Am7/G
He's told us not to blow it
          C                  C7
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile,
 
He told me,
Bb          Bbm             F         D/F#
   "Let the children lose it, let the children use it,
Gm             C
   Let all the children boogie."
 
F         Dm
  Starman waiting in the sky
     Am               Am7/G

          F       Dm

          C                   C7
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile,
 
He told me,
Bb          Bbm             F         D/F#

Bb          F            C            F
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la 
Bb          F            C            F
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la 
Bb          F            C            F
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la 
Bb          F            C            F
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la 
 
(Fade out)
