THE LOOK METRONOMY
 
 
[Verses]
Dm  Dm7      Dm            Dm7
You're up but you'll get down
 Dm               Dm7      Dm    Dm7
You're never running from this town
Am          Am7    Am  Am7
And I think you said
E       E7      E    E7             'same chord switching (Am, Am7) for rest'
You'll never get anything better than this
Dm 
'Cause you're going round in circles
Am                                  E
And everyone knows you're trouble
Dm 
'Cause you read it in a big book
                                 Am           E
And now you giving me the look look
                            Dm
But just remember how we shook shook
                          Am               E
And all the things we took took
 
This town's the oldest friend of mine
 
 
Dm          Am            E            Dm              Am         E
 
 
Dm 
Get up and we get down
 
We're always running round this town
    Am
And to think they said
E 
We'd never get anything better than this
Dm 
'Cause we're always in small circles
Am                        E
And everyone thinks we're trouble
                       Dm
We didn't read it in a big book
                              Am            E
And now we're giving you the look look
                                   Dm
But just remember how we shook shook
                             Am      E
And all the things we took took
 
This town is the oldest friend of mine
 
Dm             Am          E           Dm        Am         E
 
E 
This town, this town, this town
 
 
Solo, fade out
