[Verse]
 
                    Em                                Bm
You can tell by the way, she walks that she's my girl
                    Am                                  C
You can tell by the way, she talks she rules the world
                    Em                           Bm
You can see in her eyes that no one is her chief
         Am            C
She's my girl, my supergirl
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               G
And then she'd say it's okay
       D
I got lost on the way
                Em                         C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls don't cry
               G
And then she'd say it's alright
       D
I got home late last night
               Em                         C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls just fly
 
 
[Verse]
 
                    Em              Bm
And then she'd say that nothing can go wrong
                    Am             C
When you're in love, what can go wrong
                    Em                  Bm
And then she'd laugh the night time into day
         Am            C
Pushing her fear farther along
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               G
And then she'd say it's okay
       D
I got lost on the way
                Em                         C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls don't cry
               G
And then she'd say it's alright
       D
I got home late last night
               Em                         C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls just fly
               G
And then she'd shout down the line
                D
Tell me she's got no more time
               Em                           C
Cause she's a supergirl and supergirls don't cry
                G
And then she'd scream in my face
                    D
Tell me to leave, leave this place,
                     Em                    C
cause she's a supergirl and supergirls just fly
 
 
[Outro]
 
             G            D
She's a Supergirl, a Supergirl
              Em
She's sowing seeds
 
She's burning trees
              C
She's sowing seeds
               Em
She's burning trees
           G             D
She's a Supergirl, a Supergirl
     Em           C
A Supergirl, my Supergirl
