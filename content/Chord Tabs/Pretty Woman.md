[Lyrics]
 
A                        F#m
Pretty Woman     Walking down the street
       A                    F#m
Pretty Woman     The kind I like to meet
       D                  E
Pretty Woman    I don't believe you  You're not the truth
                                    E7
No one can look as good as you
 
(mercy)
 
       A                   F#m
Pretty Woman     Won't you pardon me
       A                    F#m
Pretty Woman     I couldn't help but see
       D                     E
Pretty Woman     You look so lovely as can be
                                 E7
Are you lonely just like me
 
(growl)
 
Dm            G
Pretty Woman stop awhile
C            Am
Pretty Woman talk awhile
Dm           G7                 C
Pretty Woman give your smile to me
Dm           G
Pretty woman Yeah Yeah Yeah
C            Am
Pretty Woman look my way
Dm           G7                   C         A
Pretty Women say you'll stay with me
        F#m              Dm                E        A
Cause I need you            I'll treat you right 
             F#m         Dm           E7
Come with me baby           Be mine tonight 
       A               F#m
Pretty Woman     Don't walk on by
       A               F#m
Pretty Woman     Don't make me cry
       D               E
Pretty Woman     Don't walk away hey ok
 
If that's the way it must be, okay
 
I guess I'll go on home   It's late
 
There'll be tomorrow night but wait
                   E7

Is she walking back to me yeah

             A
Oh ho pretty woman
