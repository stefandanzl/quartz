[Verse 1]
 
Dm7                    G
 I used to play at love
                C         Am7
 love became an empty game
Dm7                    G
 I walked away from love
                Em7          A7
 I always had myself to blame
                  Dm7         A7
 I hid my fragile dreams away
                     Am7
 My lonely heart was like a valentine
        D7
 No one cared to read the rhyme
Dm7                       Fm7
 I watched the world go by
                Em7    A7        Am7  Dm7
 Lovers hand in hand I could not understand
                   C    A7**
 But that was long ago
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your love
                   G
 Thank you for the heart
             C                             Am7
 Oh girl you taught me how to feel the joy again
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your love
                   G
 Thank you for the heart
            C                            Am7
 I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Dm7                    G
 And in your younger days
                   C         A7
 Girl you hid your heart away
Dm7                      G
 Those were the hungry days
                 Em7       A7
 Waiting for someone to say
                         Dm7       A7
 Those tender words that never came
                   Am7
 Fragile nights of wishing on a star
          D7
 Love was near & yet so far
Dm7                      Fm7
 And when you fell for me
               Em7      A7     Am7       Dm7
 I never had a clue and when i noticed you
                  Em7     A7          Am7    Dm7
 My heart already knew my dreams were coming true
                      Em7     A7     Am7   Dm7
 And now we smile and say goodbye to yesterday
                C        A7**
 Cause that was long ago
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  Dm7
 Thank you for the hope
                   G
 Thank you for the joy
             C                              Am7
 Oh girl you taught my lonely heart to sing again
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your kiss
                   G
 Thank you for the touch
            C                            Am7
 I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again

                     C                     Am7
 There'll never be a long and lonely night again
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your love
                   G
 Thank you for the heart
                   C                    Am7
 Girl please don't ever let me be alone again
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your love
                   G
 Thank you for the heart
             C                             Am7
 Oh girl you taught me how to feel the joy again
 
                    Dm7
 Thank you for your love
                   G
 Thank you for the heart
            C                            Am7
 I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
