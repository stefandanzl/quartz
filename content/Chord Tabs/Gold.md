CAPO 6
 
[Intro]
 
Am (let ring) 
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am (let ring) 
Another one, another you
It's gotta be love I said it
 
Am (let ring) 
You gotta know, I'm feeling love - repeat line
 
Am (let ring) 
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am (let ring) 
Another one, another you
It's gotta be love I said it
 
[Verse]
 
Am                 G                 D  F
I might as well be in a garden
I said, ah
Am               G                   D  F
A smell in the air is a dripping rose
(You could be the one for me)
Am          G             D        F
Another soul to meet my void then
Am            G                  D    F
Of anything bare that's made of gold
 
Am          G                 D       F
A physical kiss is nothing without it
Am                   G                 D        F
And you close your eyes to see what it's done
Am               G                   D      F
The body that lies is built up on looking
Am                G                  D      F
Cause all that remains before it's begun
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                G
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
D             F
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am            G
Another one, another you
D              F
It's gotta be love, I said it
 
Am                G
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
D             F
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am            G
Another one, another you
D              F
It's gotta be love, I said it
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am              G                      D   F
A heart will swell before it's hardened
Am                       G                     D  F
With the flick of the hair, it can make you old
Am                 G           D    F
Another hole to dig my soul in
Am                    G
I'll leave anything bare that keeps me sold
 
Am          G                 D       F
A physical kiss is nothing without it
Am                   G                 D        F
And you close your eyes to see what it's done
Am               G                   D      F
The body that lies is built up on looking
(no chord)
Cause all that remains before it's begun
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                G
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
D             F
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am            G
Another one, another you
D              F
It's gotta be love, I said it
 
Am                G
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
D             F
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am            G
Another one, another you
D              F
It's gotta be love, I said it
 
Am                G
You gotta know, I'm feeling love
D             F
Made of gold, I'll never love a-
Am            G
Another one, another you
D              F
It's gotta be love, I said it
