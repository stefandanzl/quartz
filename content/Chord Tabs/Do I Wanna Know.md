[Verse]
 
Em                            C     Am
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Am                                        Em
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
                         Em
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
                C             Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                                 Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
                           Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
          C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
                                    Em
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
      Em
And I play it on repeat
C         Am
 Until I fall asleep
                       B
Spilling drinks on my settee
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      C
Do I wanna know
         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
Sad to see you go
          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      C
Baby we both know
          Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
                C       Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
             Em
Cos I always do
          Em             C         Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Em
Now I've thought it through
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
 
 
[Verse]
 
                    C    Am
So have you got the guts?
                                    Em
Been wondering if your hearts still open
                   Em
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C              Am
 Simmer down and pucker up
 
I'm sorry to interrupt
     Em
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
             C        Am
Of trying to kiss you
                              Em
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
               C        Am
But we could be together
              B
if you wanted to
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      C
Do I wanna know
         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
Sad to see you go
          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      C
Baby we both know
          Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
                C       Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
             Em
Cos I always do
          Em             C         Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Em
Now I've thought it through
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      C
Do I wanna know
         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
Sad to see you go
          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      C
Baby we both know
          Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
      C
Do I wanna know
                Am
Too busy being yours to fall
        Em
Sad to see you go
                 D
Ever thought of calling darling?
      C
Do I wanna know
                Am             Em
Do you want me crawling back to you?
