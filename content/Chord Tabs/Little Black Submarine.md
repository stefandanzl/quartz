[Intro]
Am 
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am          G
Little black submarines
D      A
Operator please
Am         G       A
Put me back on the line
Am           G
Told my girl I'd be back
D      A
Operator please
Am       G          A
This is wrecking my mind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am         G
Oh, can it be
    D              A
The voices calling me
A - B - C         D      A
They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow
    D         A
But everybody knows
       C      D        A
That a broken heart is blind
A - B - C     D        A
That a broken heart is blind
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am          G
Pick you up, let you down
D      A
When I wanna go
Am         G       A
To a place I can hide
Am           G
You know me, I had plans
D      A
But they just disappeared
Am       G          A
To the back of my mind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am         G
Oh, can it be
    D              A
The voices calling me
A - B - C         D      A
They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow
    D         A
But everybody knows
       C      D        A
That a broken heart is blind
A - B - C     D        A
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 3]
 
Am          G
Treasure maps, fallen trees
D      A
Operator please
Am         G       A        (Riff)
Call me back when it's time
Am           G
Stolen friends and disease
D      A
Operator please
Am         G       A
Pass me back to my mind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am         G
Oh, can it be
    D              A
The voices calling me
A - B - C         D      A
They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow
    D         A
But everybody knows
       C      D        A
That a broken heart is blind
A - B - C     D        A
That a broken heart is blind
A - B - C     D        A
That a broken heart is blind
