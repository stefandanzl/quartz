[Verse 1]
 
G                      D
Why does the sun go on shining
Em                       Bm
Why does the sea rush to shore
Am                       Bm          E7
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Am                       Cm      D7
'Cause you don't love me anymore
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                      D
Why do the birds go on singing
Em                    Bm
Why do the stars glow above
Am                       Bm         E7
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Am             D7         G
It ended when I lost your love
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C                             G
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
C                  D           G
Why everything's the same as it was
Bm                       E7
I can't understand, no I can't understand
Am                          Cm     D7
How life goes on the way it does
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G                       D
Why does my heart go on beating
Em                      Bm
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Am                      Bm        E7
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Am                D7       G
It ended when you said goodbye
 
Eb
 
 
[Verse 5]
(spoken)
Ab                      Eb
Why does my heart go on beating
Fm                       Cm
Why do these eyes of mine cry
(sung)
Bbm                      Cm          F7
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Bbm                 Eb      Ab
It ended when you said goodbye
