Take Me Home, Country Roads
by John Denver
 
Capo 2
 
 
[Intro]
G  G/D  x4
 
[Verse 1]
G              Em             D                       C          G
  Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                    Em                    D                           C
  Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growin' 
         G
like a breeze.
 
[Chorus]
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 
[Verse 2]
G               Em                 D               C                G
 All my memories  gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
G                 Em                  D                         C              G
  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
 
[Chorus]
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 
[Bridge]
Em          D/F#          G
 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
    C       G              D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Em               F            C              G
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home 
D                D7
yesterday, yesterday.
 
[Chorus]
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 
[Outro]
        D                    G
Take me home, (down) country roads.
        D                    G
Take me home, (down) country roads.
