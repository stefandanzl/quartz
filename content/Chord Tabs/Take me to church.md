[Verse 1]
Em             Am    Em
My lover's got humour
                       Am     G
She's the giggle at a funeral
                       Am     Em
Knows everybody's disapproval
                            Am    Em
I should've worshipped her sooner
                     Am     Em
If the Heavens ever did speak
                     Am      G
She is the last true mouth piece
                        Am      Em
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
                Am    D
A fresh poison each week
                   C                      Em
'We were born sick, you heard them say it
 
                      Am    Em
My church offers no absolutes
                             Am    G
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                         Am   Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                   Am   D
Is when I'm alone with you
               C
I was born sick, but I love it
 
Command me to be well
G            C         G   Cm      G    Cm6 G  G5 F#5 F#5 F5
Aaaaaaaaa    aaaaaaaaamen. Aaaaaaaamen. Amen

[Chorus]
              Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                         A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
              Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
      Em                         A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
 
[Verse 2]
Em                     Am
If I'm a pagan of the good times
Em                Am
My lover's the sunlight
G                    Am
To keep the Goddess on my side
Em               Am
She demands a sacrifice
D 
To drain the whole sea
C 
Get something shiny
 
Em                      Am            Em
Something meaty for the main course
                       Am          G
That's a fine looking high horse
                    Am        Em
What you got in the stable?
                         Am
We've a lot of starving faithful
D 
That looks tasty
C 
That looks plenty
 
This is hungry work
 
 
 
[Chorus]
              Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
      Em                       A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
              Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
      Em                        A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
 
[Bridge]
C            G                B7           Em
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
        C            G             B7           Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        C            G          B7           Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C         G
Only then I am human
     B7            Em   Em/D Cmaj7 C
Only then I am clean
 G  C   G   Cm G    Cm6 G  G5 F#5 F#5 F5
Oh, A- men. A- men. A- men
 
[Chorus]
              Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
      Em                          A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
             Em
Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
      Em                         A5 G5 G5 F#5
Good God, let me give you my life
 
Em
