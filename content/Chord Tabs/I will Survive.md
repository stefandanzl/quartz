```chords
This sounds ok, even better if you play the bar chords starting from Am at the 5th fret
(only E and E7 would be played in the basic position). For beginners the first
position chords might be enough to start with.
Am - Dm - G - C - F - B7 - E - E7
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am                              Dm                         G
At first I was afraid, I was petrified I kept thinkin' I could never live
             C                       F                               B7
without you by my side But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've 
                           E              E7
done me wrong And I grew strong, I learned how to get along...
 
               Am              Dm                   G
And so you're back from outer space, I just walked in to find you here with 
            C                                      F
that, that look upon your face, I should have changed my fuckin' lock, I 
            B7                                    E
would have made you leave your key - If I’d have known for just one second you'd 
     E7
be back to bother me. 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       Am                Dm                  G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, Just turn around now, you're not welcome 
        F                                    B7
anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think
      E                         E7
I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
 
       Am          Dm                G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be
                 F                            B7
alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will 
   E               E7
survive, I will survive, Yeah, yeah...
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Verse]
 
         Am                                       Dm               G
It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart, I’m tryin' hard to 
                        C                        F
mend the pieces of my broken heart, And I spent oh so many nights just 
           B7                        E              E7
feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry, But now I hold my head up high. 
 
               Am                Dm                 G
And you’ll see me with somebody new, I'm not that stupid little person still 
     C                        F                                    B7
in love with you. And so you thought you’d just drop by and you expect me to 
                      E                           E7
be free, But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me, 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       Am                Dm                  G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, Just turn around now, you're not welcome 
        F                                    B7
anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think
      E                         E7
I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
 
       Am          Dm                G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be
                 F                            B7
alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, I will 
   E              E7
survive, I will survive, Yeah, yeah...
