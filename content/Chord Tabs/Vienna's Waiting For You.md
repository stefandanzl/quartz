Vienna â€“ Billy Joel
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Gm               Bb
   Slow down you crazy child
       F                 Ab
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
            Eb                      Bb
But then if you're so smart tell me why
                   C    D9sus   D
Are you still so afraid
 
Gm                              Bb
   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
          F                       Ab
You better cool it off before you burn it out
        Eb
You got so much to do and only
Bb                  Am    D9sus   D
So many hours in a day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Eb                            F
   But you know that when the truth is told
             Bb            Dm/A
That you can get what you want
           Gm        Bb/F
Or you can just get old
            Eb                   Am7        D7   Gm7      C7
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
              Gb7
When will you realize
F                 Bb
  Vienna waits for you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Gm                  Bb
   Slow down you're doing fine
             F
You can't be everything you want to be
  Ab
Before your time
              Eb                Bb             C        D9sus   D
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
 
Gm                      Bb
   Too bad but it's the life you lead
           F
You're so ahead of yourself
            Ab
That you forgot what you need
               Eb
Though you can see when you're wrong
             Bb                            Am            D9sus D
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're ri  -  ight
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Eb                           F
   You got your passion, you got your pride
    Bb                  Dm/A       Gm        Bb/F
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
Eb                     Am7             D7      Gm7   C7
   Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
              Gb7
When will you realize
F             Bb
  Vienna waits for you
 
 
[Instrumental]
| Gm  Bb   | F   Ab      |
| Eb  Bb   | Am  D9sus D |
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Eb                F
   Slow down you crazy child
             Bb            Dm/A
And take the phone off the hook
         Gm          Bb/F
And disappear for a while
Eb                         Am7            D7    Gm7   C7
   It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two
              Gb7
When will you realize
F             Bb
  Vienna waits for you
 
Eb                            F
   And you know that when the truth is told
             Bb            Dm/A
That you can get what you want
           Gm        Bb/F
Or you can just get old
            Eb                   Am7      D7     Gm7      C7
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
              Gb7
Why don't you realize
F             Bb
  Vienna waits for you
 
 
[Outro]
 
G7               Gb7
   When will you realize
F             Bb
  Vienna waits for you
