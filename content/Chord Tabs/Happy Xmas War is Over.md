Happy Xmas (War Is Over)
John Lennon
 
[Verse]
            A
So this is Christmas
                  Bm
And what have you done
             E
Another year over
                    A
And a new one just begun
    A          D
and so this is Christmas
                Em
I hope you have fun
                    A
The near and the dear one
                D
The old and the young
 
[Chorus]
              G
A very merry Christmas                            
                 A
And a happy New Year
                       Em   G
Let’s hope it’s a good one
             D    E
Without any fear
 
[Verse]
                A
And so this is Christmas
                 Bm
For weak and for strong
                      E
For rich and the poor ones
                A
The road is so long
    A        D
And so happy Christmas
                  Em
For black and for white
                   A
For yellow and red ones
                   D
Let’s stop all the fight
 
[Chorus]
              G
A very merry Christmas                            
                 A
And a happy New Year
                       Em   G
Let’s hope it’s a good one
             D    E
Without any fear
 
[Verse]
                 A
And so this is Christmas
                 Bm
And what have we done
             E
Another year over
                A
A new one just begun
    A        D
And so happy Christmas
                 Em
We hope you have fun
                   A
The near and the dear one
                 D
The old and the young
 
[Chorus]
              G
A very merry Christmas                            
                 A
And a happy New Year
                       Em   G
Let’s hope it’s a good one
             D    E
Without any fear
 
[Outro]
A
War is over, 
Bm
If you want it
E
War is over 
A
Now
