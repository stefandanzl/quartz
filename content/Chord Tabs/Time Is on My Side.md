E             A            B

Time is on my side, yes it is

You'll come running back to me

E             A            B
Time is on my side, yes it is 
C#m                  B
You're searching for good times 
C#m               F#
But just wait and see 
B           A
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more) 
B           A
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)

You'll come running back to me

A         E
Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town 
A                                    E
And baby, do everything your heart desires. Remember, I'll always be around 
A                                                   C#m
And I know, I know, like I told you so many times before, you're gonna come back, baby

'Cause I got the real love 
C#m               F#
The kind that you need 
B           A
You'll come running back (said you would, baby) 
B           A
You'll come running back (I always said you would)
B           A               B
You'll come running back to me (I won't have to worry no more)

    E                         A            B
Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
E                         A            B
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
    E                         A            B
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
