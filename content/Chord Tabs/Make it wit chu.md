[Intro]
| C       | E  A      | E       | E       |
 
[Verse 1]
C                        E    A
You wanna know if I know why?
                     E
I can’t say that I do
C                         E    A
I don’t understand the evil eye
                     E
Or how one becomes two
C                                  E      A
& I just can’t recall what started it all
                          E
Or how to begin in the end
C                 E      A
I ain’t here to break it
                            E
Just see how far it will bend
 
Again, Again, Again, Again
 
[Chorus]
C              E    A
I wanna make it
                   E
I wanna make it wit chu
 
Anytime, Anywhere
C              E    A
I wanna make it
                   E
I wanna make it wit chu
 
[Verse 2]
C 
Sometimes the same is different,
E    A               E
but mostly it’s the same
C                      E  A                       E
these mysteries of life, that jus ain’t my thing
C                               E    A
if I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon,
          E
I’d be untrue
C                              E  A
The only thing I know for sure
                  E
Is what I wanna do
 
anytime, anywhere, I say
 
[Chorus] (x2)
C               E   A
I wanna make it
                   E
I wanna make it wit chu
 
Anytime, Anywhere
C               E   A
I wanna make it
                   E
I wanna make it wit chu
 
[Solo + Chorus vocals at the end part]
