[Intro]
Cmaj7  Asus2  Fsus2/E  Asus2 
Cmaj7  Asus2  Fsus2/E  Asus2 
 
[Verse 1]
Cmaj7         Asus2
Hello, I've waited here for you 
Fsus2/E   Asus2 
   E_____verlong
Cmaj7           Asus2
Tonight, I throw myself into
Fsus2/E        Asus2
And out of the red
            Asus2
Out of her head, she sang
 
[Instrumental]
Cmaj7  Asus2  Fsus2/E  Asus2 
 
[Verse 2]
Cmaj7          Asus2
Come down, and waste away with me
Fsus2/E    Asus2 
Down      with me 
Cmaj7              Asus2
Slow how you wanted it to be
Fsus2/E        Asus2                        (Riff)
And over my head, out of her head she sang
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G   Cmaj7 (Riff) 
And I wonder
G            Cmaj7 (Riff)
When I sing along with you
 
[Chorus]
Am                       Fsus2/E          Cmaj7
If everything could ever feel this real forever
Am                     Fsus2/E        Cmaj7
If anything could ever be this good again
Am                       Fsus2/E
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
  Cmaj7                           G              Fsus2/E
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
 
[Verse 3]
Cmaj7               Asus2
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Fsus2/E  Asus2 
Hold    you in 
Cmaj7          Asus2
And now I know you've always been
Fsus2/E      Asus2                       (Riff)
And over my head, out of my head I sang
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G   Cmaj7 (Riff) 
And I wonder
G            Cmaj7 (Riff)
When I sing along with you
 
[Chorus]
Am                       Fsus2/E          Cmaj7
If everything could ever feel this real forever
Am                     Fsus2/E        Cmaj7
If anything could ever be this good again
Am                       Fsus2/E
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
  Cmaj7                       G              Fsus2/E
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
