[Verse 1]
E          C                C#m   A    G A G
  It's the cruelest joke to play
E        C             C#m     A   G A G
  I'm so high I run in place
E        C           C#m    A   G A G
  Only a line we separate   So...

E5                               G5
  I keep on playing our favorite song
                            D5
  I turn it up while you're gone
                                      D#5

E5                               G5
  I keep on playing our favorite song
                            D5
