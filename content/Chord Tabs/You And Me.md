If the stars don't shine, if the moon won't rise,

if I never see the setting sun again.

If you love a soul more than fame and gold, 
         F                         C
and that soul feels the same about you.
 
       C                         Em
It's a natural fact.  There's no turning back, 
    F                      C

You got to say it's...

When love is real, you don't have to show it.

When it is true, then everyone will know it.
