[Intro]
 
A   C Em
D G C
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
A       C      Em
Jesus Christ, girl
D               G        C
What are people gonna think
         A                       C    Em
When I show up to one of several funerals        D           G           C
I've attended for grandpa this week
C 
With you, with me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
B7                        C    G
Someone's got to help me dig
B7                        C   G
Someone's got to help me dig
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A       C      Em
Jesus Christ, girl
D               G          C
It hasn't been long so it seems
             A                           C       Em
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
    D         G     C
At the Hollywood Cemetery
C 
You kiss, on me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
B7                           C    G
We should let this dead guy sleep
B7                           C    G
We should let this dead guy sleep
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A       C      Em
Jesus Christ, girl
   D           G         C
I laid up for hours in a daze
     A                           C       Em
Retracing the expanse of your American back
     D             G          C
With Adderall and weed in my veins
C 
You came, I think
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            B7                         C    G
Cause the marble made my cheeks look pink 
        B7                   C    G
But I'm unsure of so many things 
 
Ooooooooh
 
Am      C     Em   D
G       C
 
[Chorus]
 
B7                       C    G
Someone's got to help me dig
B7                       C    G
Someone's got to help me dig
B7                       C    G
Someone's got to help me dig
