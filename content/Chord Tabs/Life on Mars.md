the song up to the key of G and therefore cannot be played along with the original recording.
 
PICKING PATTERN:
For the verse, pick with the following pattern - the bass note and
first and second strings all simultaneously, then the third string.  For
the chorus, strum.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
 G      G/F#            Dm/F          E7                  Am
It's a god-awful small affair to the girl with the mousy hair
         Am/G              D/F#                              G
But her mummy is yelling "No" and her daddy has told her to go
          G/F#                  Dm/F
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
        E7                       Am
now she walks through her sunken dream
        Am/G                  D/F#
To the seat with the clearest view
                                Bb
and she's hooked to the silver screen
          Bb+                Gm
But the film is a saddening bore
            G#                   Eb
For she's lived it ten times or more
           G7                   Cm          Eb
She could spit in the eyes of fools as they ask her to focus on
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C         F                   G
Sailors, fighting in the dance hall
 Am      Fm                    G  Gm                  Dm
Oh man! look at those cavemen go,    it's a freakest show
Fm                   C      F                    G
Take a look at the Lawman, beating up the wrong guy
Am       Fm                     G Gm                          Dm
Oh man!  Wonder if he'll ever know   he's in the best selling show
Fm                Am   C+  Am7  D7  F  Gsus4  D
Is there life on Mars?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
 G       G/F#                   Dm/F
It's on Amerika's tortured brow
            E7                       Am
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
        Am/G                         D/F#
Now the workers have struck for fame
      G        G/F#              Dm/F
Cause Lennon's on sale again
 G       G/F#              Dm/F
See the mice in their million hordes
        E7                    Am
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
         Am/G               D/F#
Rule Brittania is out of bounds
      G        G/F#          Dm/F
To my mother, my dog and clowns
        Bb+                     Gm
But the film is a saddening bore
         G#                         Eb
`Cause I wrote it ten times or more
      G7                   Cm
It's about to be writ again
     Eb
As I ask you to focus on
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C         F                   G
Sailors, fighting in the dance hall
 Am      Fm                    G  Gm                  Dm
Oh man! look at those cavemen go,    it's a freakest show
Fm                   C      F                    G
Take a look at the Lawman, beating up the wrong guy
Am       Fm                     G Gm                          Dm
Oh man!  Wonder if he'll ever know   he's in the best selling show
Fm                Am   C+  Am7  D7  F  Gsus4  D
Is there life on Mars?
