[Intro]
G  Gsus4 G
 
[Verse 1]
G                 Am    D         D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C             Am       D      G        Gsus4  G
Just like the ones I used to know.
          G    Gmaj7   G7
Where the tree tops glisten,
    C        Cm
And children listen,
   G    Em                  Am      D   D7
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
 
[Verse 2]
G                 Am    D         D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C           Am          D     G      Gsus4  G
 With every Christmas card I write.
         G    Gmaj7   G7        C      Cm
May your days be merry and bright,
        G   Em   Am      D      G
And may all your Christmases be white.

 Just like the ones I used to know.

Where the tree tops glisten,
    C        Cm

To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
