[Verse]
 
D   C    D   G     Em
Oh baby, oh man
       D          C            D             G       Em
You're making me crazy, really driving me mad
D           C                  D             G       Em
That's all right with me, it's really no fuss
   D               C                   D        G       Em
As long as you're next to me, just the two of us
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       G   Am  Bm  C           Am
You're my, my, my,  my kind of woman
G   Am Bm  C        Am
My, oh my,   what a girl
       G   Am  Bm  C           Am
You're my, my, my,  my kind of woman
        G           Am              Bm                  C     Am
And I'm down on my hands and knees, begging you please, baby, show me your world
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Em
 
 
[Verse]
 
D   C       D         G     Em
Oh brother, sweetheart
    D          C             D        G        Em
I'm feeling so tired, really falling apart
       D                C             D            G        Em
And it just don't make sense to me, I really don't know
    D               C               D        G       Em
Why you stick right next to me, wherever I go
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       G   Am  Bm  C           Am
You're my, my, my,  my kind of woman
G   Am Bm  C        Am
My, oh my,   what a girl
       G   Am  Bm  C           Am
You're my, my, my,  my kind of woman
        G           Am              Bm                  C     Am
And I'm down on my hands and knees, begging you please, baby, show me your world
 
 
[End]
 
Em
