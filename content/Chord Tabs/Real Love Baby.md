[Intro]
D Em G
 
[Verse]
    D
Our hearts
    Em
Are free
           G
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
      D                 Em
I'm a flower, you're my bee
          G
It's much older than you and me
       D         Em
I'm in love, I'm alive
  G
I belong to the stars and sky
      D                         Em
Let's forget who we are for one night
          G
We're not animals baby
G 
It's the people who lie
 
 
[Chorus]
       D
I want real love baby
Em 
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
         G
I've got real love maybe
G 
Wait until you taste me
       D
I want real love baby
Em 
There's a world inside me
        G
Got the preacher's music
G 
Just if for a minute
 
 
[Verse]
    D
Our hearts
    Em
Are free
           G
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling

I'm a flower, you're my bee
          G
It's much older than you and me
       D          Em
I'm in love, I'm alive
    G
I belong to the stars and sky
      D                         Em
Let's forget who we are for one night
          G
We're not animals baby

It's the people who lie

I'm a flower, you're my bee
(I want real love baby, there's a world inside me)

It's much older than you and me
(Got the preacher's music, just if for a minute)
