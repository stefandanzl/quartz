[Intro]
 
E   C#m
 
 
[Verse]
 
                  E
Lay where you're laying
                  E
Don't make a sound
                C#m
I know they're watching
                C#m
They're watching
 
 
            E
All the commotion
            E
the kiddie like play
           C#m
Has people talking
           C#m
Talking
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E 
You
                 C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
 
 
[Verse]
 
                E
The dark of the alley
                E
The break of the day
                  C#m
Head while I'm driving
                  C#m
I'm driving
 
              E
Soft lips are open
              E
Them knuckles are pale
                  C#m
Feels like you're dying
        A
You're dying
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E 
You
                 C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
    E
Consumed
                     C#m    A
With what's to transpire
 
 
[Verse]
 
          E
Hot as a fever
          E
Rattling bones
              C#m
I could just taste it
              C#m
Taste it
 
 
                E
But it's not forever
                E
But it's just tonight
                     C#m
Oh we're still the greatest
                     C#m
The greatest
                     C#m
The greatest
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E 
You
                 C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
 
E 
You
                C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
 
    E
Consumed
                     C#m    A
With what's to transpire
 
    E
And You
                C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
 
    E
Consumed
                     C#m     A      E
With what's to transpire
