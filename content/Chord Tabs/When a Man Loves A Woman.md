When A Man Loves A Woman chords
Percy Sledge
 
Capo I
 
C G Am G F G7 C  G
 
[Verse]
 
       C           G    Am                    G
When a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothing else
F               G7                       C           G
He'd change the world, for the good thing he's found
         C             G     Am              G
If she's bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong,
F                    G7                C            G
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
 
       C           G    Am                G
When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
F              G7            C    G
Trying to hold on to what he needs
             C          G       Am                     G
He'd give up all of his comforts, and sleep out in the rain
F                      G7              C  C7
If she says that's the way it ought to be
 
[Chorus]
 
F                        C    C7
Well this man loves you, woman
F                          C  C7
I'll give you everything I can
F                    C    G          Am
Trying to hold on to your high class love
D7                          G  G7
Baby, please don't treat me bad
 
[Verse]
 
       C           G    Am                 G
When a man loves a woman, deep down in his soul,
F             G7            C     G
She can bring him such misery
       C               G   Am               G
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
F      G7             C  G
Loving eyes can never see
 
       C           G    Am              G
When a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong,
F            G7           C  G
He can never hold another girl
            C           G    Am               G
Yes, when a man loves a woman, I know exactly how he feels
F            G7               C   G
'Cause baby, baby, you are my girl
 
[Outro]
 
       C           G    Am
When a man loves a woman . . .
