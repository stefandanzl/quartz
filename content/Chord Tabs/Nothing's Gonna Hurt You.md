```chords
[This chord progression is super simple if you can play bar chords, I didn't see it anywhere so I thought I'd
put one together for all that want it. Just say if there's anything that's wrong]
 
 
E B F#m A
E B F#m A
 
[Verse 1]
E             B                 F#m     A
    Whispered something in your ear
E            B           F#m            A
    It was a perverted thing to say
E         B             F#m       A
    But I said it anyway 
E   B                  F#m        A
    Made you smile and look away
 
 
[Chorus]
E    B                        F#m      A
     Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
E    B                                F#m            A
     As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
E    B                        F#m      A
     Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
E    B                        F#m            A
     Nothing's gonna take you from my side
 
 
[Verse 2]
E            B                   F#m      A
     When we dance in my living room 
E            B             F#m        A
     To that silly 90's R&B 
E            B                F#m       A
     When we have a drink or three 
E            B               F#m         A
     Always ends in a hazy shower scene
 
 
[Chorus]
E    B                        F#m      A
     Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
E    B                                F#m            A
     As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
E    B                        F#m      A
     Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
E    B                        F#m            A
     Nothing's gonna take you from my side
 
E B F#m A
E B F#m A
 
[Bridge]
             E              B              F#m        A
     When we laugh into the microphone and sing 
              E             B               F#m       A
     With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs 
                E               B              F#m       A
     When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
              E             B               F#m       A
     With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
 
E B F#m A
E B F#m A
 
[Chorus]
E    B                        F#m      A
     Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
E    B                        F#m            A
     Nothing's gonna take you from my side
