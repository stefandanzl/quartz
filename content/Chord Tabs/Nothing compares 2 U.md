[Verse 1]
 
F                         C
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                        C
I go out every night and sleep all day
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                                 C
Since you been gone I can do what-ever I want
Dm                           F  C
I can see whomever I choose
F                              C
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
    Dm                                A
but nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
     Eb         Bb
'cos nothing compares
Eb         Bb        C
nothing compares 2 U.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F                      C
It's been so lonely without U here
Dm                             F  C
like a bird without a song
F                            C
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Dm                          Bb
tell me baby where did I go wrong?
F                               C
I could put my arms around every boy I see
Dm                             F  C
but they only remind me of U.
F                                     C
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me guess what he told me
Dm                                              A
he said: "girl U better try to have fun no matter what U do"
A
but he's a fool
     Eb         Bb
'cos nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.

[Outro]
 
F 
All the flowers that U planted mama
C 
in the back yard
Dm                          F  C
all died when U went away
F                                  C
I know that living with U baby was sometimes hard
Dm                               A
but I'm willing 2 give U another try
  Eb         Bb
nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.
  Eb         Bb
nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.
  Eb         Bb
nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.
