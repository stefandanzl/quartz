```chords


 
 
[Verse 1]
  F
I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                   F7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    A#                                              F
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
         C7                                     F
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
 
 
[Verse 2]
     F
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                            F7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
      A#                                    F
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       C7                                           F
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
  F
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                     F7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
        A#                                      F
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
          C7                                             F
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
              F
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                              F7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
A#                                             F
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        C7                                       F
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
