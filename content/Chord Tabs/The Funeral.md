[Verse]
 
F             C       G        Am
I'm coming up only to hold you under
F             C       G           Am
And coming up only to show you're wrong
F      C           G        Am
And to know you is hard, we wonder
F  C            G         Am
To know you all wrong, we warn
 
F C G Am
Oooooooooooh
F C G Am
Oooooooooooh
 
F          C       G           Am
Really too late to call, so we wait for
F          C           G      Am
Morning to wake you is all we got
F  C          G      Am
To know me as hardly golden
F     C           G           Am
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                         C             F
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
G                        C                     F
And every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
G                          C             F
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
G                           C           F
And every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
 
 
[Verse]
 
F             C       G           Am
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
F             C       G           Am
And coming up only to show you're wrong
 
F      C            G               Am
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
F   C               G        Am
For they don't have trees to hang upon
 
F C G Am
Oooooooooooh
F C G Am
Oooooooooooh
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                         C             F
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
G                        C                     F
And every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
G                          C             F
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
G                           C           F
And every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
