CHORDS:
G      320033
Em     022000
D      xx0232
Am     x02210
Am7    x02010
C      x32010
FM7    x33210
Fadd9  xx3213
 
I've put both Am and Am7 as I'm not sure exactly which is the original chord. I
prefer Am7 when I'm playing with a capo. But it's really down to the individual
and how you hear it.
 
To make this a bit more interesting, try hammering on the e when playing the D and
Am chords. Listen to the song for the timing.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G               D
Maybe I don't really want to know
         Am
How your garden grows
  C             D
As I just want to fly
G               D
Lately did you ever feel the pain
         Am
In the morning rain
  C                    D
As it soaks you to the bone
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
Em                   D
Maybe I just want to fly
                           Am
Wanna live, I don't want to die
                     C
Maybe I just want to breathe
      D            Em
Maybe I just don't believe
                       D
Maybe you're the same as me
                           Am
We see things they'll never see
                           Fadd9
You and I, we're gonna live forever
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        G             D
I said maybe I don't really wanna know
                Am
How your garden grows
      C              D
Cause I just want to fly
G                    D
Lately did you ever feel the pain
                Am
In the morning rain
     C               D
As it soaks you to the bone
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Em                 D
Maybe I will never be
                          Am
All the things that I wanna be
                       C
Now is not the time to cry
          D               Em
Now's the time to find out why
                          D
I think you're the same as me
                          Am
We see things they'll never see
                          Fadd9
You and I are gonna live forever
