[Verse 1]
 
(G)    D          C     G
In the town where I was born
Em      Am       C        D
Lived a man who sailed to sea
G      D       C      G
And he told us of his life
Em     Am      C    D
In the land of submarines
 
G     D         C      G
So we sailed up to the sun
Em      Am        C      D
Till we found the sea of green
G      D       C         G
And we lived beneath the waves
Em     Am     C    D
In our yellow submarine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G       D           C      G
And our friends are all on board
Em   Am           C         D
Many more of them live next door
G       D      C       G
And the band begins to play
 
[Brass]
G 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

G D C G Em Am C D
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G     D      C       G
As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Em   Am                              C      D
Everyone of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
G      D                      C      G
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
Em     Am                     C    D
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine - aha! )
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
 
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
