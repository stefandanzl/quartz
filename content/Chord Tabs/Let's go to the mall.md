Let's go to the mall, you won't be sorry
A           Bm
Put on your jelly bracelets
D                 E
And your cool graffiti coat

Let's go to the mall ... today
 
[VERSE2]
There's this boy I like
Met him at the food court
He's got hair like Gretzky
And he does jumps on his skateboard
 
I hope he asks me out
Takes me to my favorite spot
It'll be just him and me
(But don't forget the robot)
 
[BRIDGE]
Dad says I'm too young to date (Lame!)
But baby, I don't want to wait (Let's do it!)
That's OK, I'm going to rock your body anyway
I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day
 
[CHORUS]
Everybody come and play
Throw every last care away
Let's go to the mall today
 
[VERSE3 (rap)]
I went to the mall with a couple of friends
I had a whole week's allowance to spend
I want hoop earrings and a Benetton shirt
We came here to shop and we came here to flirt
 
I turned around and who should I see
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
He said, "Young lady, I don't approve."
So I had to get down and bust a crazy move
 
{Hit it Fred, come on
Let's go to the mall
Let's go to the mall, everybody!}
 
[CHORUS]
Everybody come and play
Throw every last care away
Let's go to the mall today
 
[OUTRO (same chords as Verse)]
Everybody loves the mall!
Everybody come and play (Yeah!)
Throw every last care away (I love my hoop earrings!)
Let's go to the mall today
