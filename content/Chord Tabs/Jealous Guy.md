Jealous Guy (Lennon)
 
This is a bit of a mix of the Lennon original and the Roxy Music cover...
 
 
[Intro]
  G / Em / D / / / D7 / / / Em / / /
 
[Verse 1]
  G         Em              D   D6 [ D7 ]
      I was dreaming of the past 
  D7                           Em   Em7
      and my heart was beating fast. 
  Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
      I began to lose control, 
  Em      Em7            C
      I began to lose control. 
 
[Chorus]
  G            Dm/F         C   Dsus4
      I didn't mean to hurt you, 
  G             Dm/F   Bb
      I'm sorry that I made you cry. 
  G            G/F#           Em  Em7/D
      I didn't want to hurt you, 
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy. 
 
[Verse 2]
  G         Em          D   D6 [ D7 ]
      I was feeling insecure, 
  D7                           Em   Em7
      you might not love me anymore. 
  Em6                    D    Dsus4 D
      I was shivering inside, 
  Em        Em7          C
      I was shivering inside. 
 
[Chorus]
  G            Dm/F         C   Dsus4
      I didn't mean to hurt you, 
  G             Dm/F   Bb
      I'm sorry that I made you cry. 
   G            G/F#               Em   Em7/D
      Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you, 
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy.

   G         Em              D   D6 [ D7 ]

  D7                                 Em     Em7
      thought that you was trying to hide.

      I'm sorry that I made you cry.

      Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you, 
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy, watch out, 
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy, look out, babe, 
  C                      G
      I'm just a jealous guy.
