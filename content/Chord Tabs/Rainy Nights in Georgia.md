Rainy Night in Georgia - Tony Joe White
 
[Intro]
Dmaj7   Cmaj7   Dmaj7   Cmaj7
 
[Verse 1]
Dmaj7                     G6
Hov'rin by my suitcase, trying to find a warm place to
Dmaj7                    Dmaj7
spend the night.
Dmaj7                 G6
Heavy rain a falling, seems I hear your voice calling
Dmaj7                 Dmaj7
it's alright.
 
[Chorus]
Bm7              F#m7     Bm7              F#m7
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia, I believe it's
Em          G6       Dmaj7          Cmaj7      Dmaj7      Cmaj7
raining all over the world.
 
[Verse 2]
     Dmaj7
Neon signs a-flashing
     G6                                Dmaj7       Dmaj7
Taxicabs and buses passing through the night.
     Dmaj7
The distant moaning of a train,
     G6                            Dmaj7         Dmaj7
seems to play a sad refrain to the night.
 
[Chorus]
Bm7              F#m7     Bm7              F#m7
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia, I believe it's
Em          G6       Dmaj7          Cmaj7      Dmaj7      Cmaj7
raining all over the world.
 
[Bridge]
Cmaj7               Dmaj7    Cmaj7                   Dmaj7
How many times I've wondered, it still comes out the same. No
G6            F#m           Em7
matter how you look at it, think of it, you
G6          F#m7  Em7  Dmaj7      Cmaj7      Dmaj7     Dmaj7
just got to do    your own thing.
 
[Verse 3]
  Dmaj7
I find me a place in a box car,
     G6                              Dmaj7      Dmaj7
so I take my guitar out to pass some time.
     Dmaj7
Late at night when it's hard to rest,
     G6                              Dmaj7       Dmaj7
I hold your picture to my chest and I'm alright.
 
[Chorus]
Bm7              F#m7     Bm7              F#m7
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia, I believe it's
Em          G6       Dmaj7          Cmaj7      Dmaj7      Cmaj7
raining all over the world.
 
[Outro] (Repeat and fade out)
Dmaj7          Cmaj7
