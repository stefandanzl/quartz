[Chorus]
                      C
Whiskey River take my mind
                             G
Don't let her memory torture me
                        D7
Whiskey River don't run dry
                                 G
You're all I've got take care of me
G                     C
Whiskey River take my mind
                             G
Don't let her memory torture me
                        D7
Whiskey River don't run dry
                                 G
You're all I've got take care of me
 
[Verse 1]
  G                        C
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
G 
Bathing my mem'ried mind
       A7             D7
In the wetness of its soul
G 
Feeling the amber current
G7              C
Flowing from my mind
    D7                          G
And leaving a heart you left so cold
 
[Chorus]
                      C
Whiskey River take my mind
                             G
Don't let her memory torture me
                        D7
Whiskey River don't run dry
                                 G
You're all I've got take care of me
