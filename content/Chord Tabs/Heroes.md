[Verse]
 
D                    G
I - I wish you could swim
         D                            G
Like the dolphins - like dolphins can swim
       C                                D
Though nothing - nothing will keep us together
       Am       Em            D
We can beat them  forever and ever
             C     G             D
Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

And you - you will be Queen
    C                        D
For nothing will drive them away
          Am     Em             D
We can be Heroes - just for one day

I - I can remember (I remember)
D               G
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
        D            G
And the guards shot above our heads (Over our heads)
       D                              G
And we kissed as though nothing would fall (Nothing could fall)
 
[Bridge]
 
        C                D
And the shame was on the other side
          Am           Em       D
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
               C      G             D
Then we can be Heroes  just for one day

We can be Heroes just for one day
