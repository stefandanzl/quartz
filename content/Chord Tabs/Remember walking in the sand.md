Dm 
Seems like the other day
Bb 
My baby went away
Gm                      A7
He went away 'cross the sea
Dm 
It's been two years or so
Bb 
Since I saw my baby go
Gm                            A7
And then this letter came for me
 
Dm 
He said that we were through
Bb 
He's found somebody new
Gm 
Let me think, let me think
           A7
What can I do?
 
Dm 
Oh no
Dm 
Oh no
Bb 
Oh no, no, no, no, no
 
Dm 
(Remember) Walking in the sand
Dm 
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
Dm 
(Remember) The night was so exciting
Dm 
(Remember) Smile was so inviting
Dm 
(Remember) Then he touched my cheek
Dm 
(Remember) With his finger tips
Dm                             A7
(Remember) Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips
 
 
Dm 
What ever happened to
Bb 
The boy that I once knew?
Gm                       A7
The boy who said he'd be true
Dm 
Oh, what happened to
Bb 
The life I gave to you
Gm                     A7
What will I do with it now?
 
Dm 
(Remember) Walking in the sand
Dm 
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
Dm 
(Remember) The night was so exciting
Dm 
(Remember) Smile was so inviting
Dm 
(Remember) Then he touched my cheek
Dm 
(Remember) With his finger tips......
