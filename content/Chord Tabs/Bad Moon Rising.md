Bad Moon Rising - Creedence Clearwater Revival
 
[Intro]
| D   | A G | D   | D   |
 
[Verse 1]
D         A   G      D
I see the bad moon a-rising
D     A       G     D
I see trouble on the way
D     A    G          D
I see earthquakes and lightning
D     A   G       D
I see bad times today
 
[Chorus]
G
Don't go around tonight
           D
Well, it's bound to take your life
A         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise
 
[Verse 2]
D      A    G       D
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
D          A      G      D
I know the end is coming soon
D      A      G   D
I fear rivers overflowing
D          A        G        D
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
 
[Chorus]
G
Don't go around tonight
           D
Well, it's bound to take your life
A         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise
 
[Solo]
| D   | A G | D   | D   |
| D   | A G | D   | D   |
| G   | G   | D   | D   |
| A   | G   | D   | D   |
 
[Verse 3]
D        A        G       D
Hope you got your things together
D            A     G           D
Hope you are quite prepared to die
D                A      G     D
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
D          A     G      D
One eye is taken for an eye
 
[Chorus]
      G
Well, don't go around tonight
           D
Well, it's bound to take your life
A         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise
 
G
Don't go around tonight
           D
Well, it's bound to take your life
A         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise
