[Intro]
Am Em C D Am
Am Em C D Am
Am Em C D Am
Am Em C D Am

 
[Verse 1]
         Am          Em
She's got cherry lips, angel eyes
C          D            Am
She knows exactly how to tantalize
Am                          Em
She's out to get you, danger by design
C            D               Am
Cold blooded vixen, she don't compromise


Am                         Em
She's something mystical in colored lights
C           D           Am
So far from typical, but take my advice
Am                       Em
Before you play with fire, do think twice
C              D                   Am
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

[Pre-chorus]
       Am              Em
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
C       D              Am
And ooh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
Am                Em
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?


[Chorus]
Am                    Em
Sugar, how you get so fly?
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?
       Am                    Em
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
C              D      Em
Sugar, how you get so fly?

 
[Instrumental]
Am Em C D Am

[Verse 2]
Am                          Em
Sweet talking lady, love how you entice
C          D               Am
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Am                       Em
Charming, alluring, everyone's desire
C            D                  Am
She's out to get you, you can't run, you can't hide

Am                         Em
She's something mystical in colored lights
C           D           Am
So far from typical, but take my advice
Am                       Em
Before you play with fire, do think twice
C              D                  Am
And if you get burned, well baby, don't you be surprised


[Pre-chorus]
       Am              Em
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
C       D              Am
And ooh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
Am                Em
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?

[Chorus]
Am                    Em
Sugar, how you get so fly?
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?
       Am                    Em
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
C             D        Em
But you won't get me tonight!


[Pre-chorus]
       Am              Em
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceiling
C       D              Am
And ooh baby, it's the ultimate feeling
Am                Em
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Am                    Em
Sugar, how you get so fly?
C              D      Am
Sugar, how you get so fly?
       Am                    Em
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
C              D      Em
Sugar, how you get so fly?
