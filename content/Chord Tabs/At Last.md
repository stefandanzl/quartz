[Intro]
| F  F7/A  |  Bb Bdim7 | F/C F/Eb  D7b9  | Db7 C9 ||
 
[Verse 1]
   F    Dm7   Gm7
At last
   C7#5            F    Dm7   Gm7
My love has come along
    C7             F    Dm7   Gm7
My lonely days are over
    C7             F F7/Eb D7 Db7 Gm7/C C9
And life is like a song        Ooh yeah, yeah 
    F    Dm7   Gm7
At last
  C7#5               F    Dm7   Gm7
The skies above are blue
  C7                         F    Dm7   Gm7
My heart was wrapped up in clover
  C7                   F  Bb | Fmaj9 |
The night I looked at you
 
 
[Bridge]
          Gm7    C7
I found a dream
          Fmaj7    F6
That I could speak to
            E7 F7 E7       Am7
A dream that I can call my own
Dm7            G7
I found a thrill
            Cmaj7   C#dim7
To press my cheek to
            Dm7   G7      C7
A thrill that I have never known
 
 
[Verse 2]
    F   Dm7
You smile
         Gm7
You smile
      C7#5                  F   Dm7  Gm7
Oh and then the spell was cast
    C7          F   Dm7
And here we are in heaven
Gm7           C9
For you are mine at last
 
[Outro]
