[Verse 1]
 
        F#m                     D                 Bm
I'm a puppet on a string, Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond
       F#m                             D                Bm
cutter shaped heartaches, that come to find ya, four in some velvet morning
F#m                            D               Bm
Years too late, she's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
           F#m               D                   Bm
Through an open space, in my mind when she's not right there beside me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m                D                       Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
    F#m            D                      Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
    F#m                      D Bm                             F#m    D  Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
        F#m        D    Bm
Are you mine?
        F#m        D    Bm
Are you mine?
        F#m        D    Bm
Are you mine?  (Oh ah)
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
F#m     D   Bm
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
             F#m                             D               Bm
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end, keep imagining meeting,
F#m                D                 Bm
Wished away entire lifetimes, unfair we're not somewhere
F#m              D             Bm
Misbehaving for days, great escape
              F#m                            D               Bm
Lost track of time and space, she's a silver lining climbing on my desire and
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m                D                       Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
    F#m            D                      Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
    F#m                      D Bm                             F#m    D  Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
        F#m              D     Bm
Are you mine?  (Are you mine tomorrow?)
        F#m              D     Bm
Are you mine?  (Or just mine tonight?)
        F#m              D    Bm
Are you mine?  (Are you mine, mine?)
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
F#m     D   Bm
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bm                    D                         F#m
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
      A
So in case I'm mistaken,
Bm                    D       C#     Bm
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Am      F#m
Are you mine?
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Verse]
 
N.C.
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
N.C.
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     F#m          D                          Bm
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
        F#m          D                      Bm
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
    F#m                  D     Bm                   F#m             D  Bm
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
        F#m              D     Bm
Are you mine?  (Are you mine tomorrow?)
        F#m              D     Bm
Are you mine?  (Or just mine tonight?)
        F#m              D     Bm
Are you mine?  (Are you mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?)
