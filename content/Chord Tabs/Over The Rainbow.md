[Intro]
C   Em   Am   F
C   G    Am   Fadd9  F   F
 
[Verse]
C     Em    F    C
Oooo, oooo, oooo ...
F     E7    Am   F
Oooo, oooo, oooo ...
 
[Chorus]
C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow
F        C
  Way up high 
F       C
And the dreams that you dream of
G              Am      F
Once in a lullaby-y-y ... y-y-y
     C        Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F            C
  Blue birds fly
F       C
And the dreams that you dream of
G                     Am          F
Dreams really do come true-ue-ue ... ooh-ooh-ooh
 
[Verse]
    C
Someday I'll wish upon a star
G                                  Am       F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind ... me-e-e
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G
High above the chimney tops
       Am               F
That's where ... you'll fi-ind me 
[Chorus]
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F            C
  Blue birds fly
F       C
And the dream that you dare to
   G                 Am      F
Oh why, oh why can't I-I-I ... Ah-ah-ay 
[Verse]
    C
Someday I'll wish upon a star
G                                  Am       F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind ... me-e-e
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G
High above the chimney tops
       Am               F
That's where ... you'll fi-ind me 
[Chorus]
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F        C
  Way up high 
F       C
And the dreams that you dare to
G                 Am     F
Why, oh why can't I-I-I ... Ah-ah-ay
 
[Outro] (fade out)
C     Em    F    C
Oooo, oooo, oooo ...
F     E7    Am   F      C
Oooo, oooo,  Oo-ah-ah ...
