[Verse]
   E                    A      G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
        B                        E
Tell me where did you sleep last night
       E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                      E
I would shiver the whole night through
 
[Chorus]
   E                    A        G
My girl, my girl, where will you go
    B                         E
I'm going where the cold wind blows
       E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                      E
I would shiver the whole night through
 
[Verse]
    E                   A       G
Her husband, was a hard working man
      B                E
Just about a mile from here
    E                   A       G
His head was found in a driving wheel
        B              E
But his body never was found
 
[Verse]
   E                    A      G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
        B                        E
Tell me where did you sleep last night
       E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                      E
I would shiver the whole night through

Where the sun don't ever shine
