```chords
[Intro]
F  C  Bb  C
 
[Verse 1]
F                            Fmaj7
Raindrops keep falling on my head
    F7                               Bb              Am
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
D7               Am   D7    Gm7                                              Bb   C
Nothing seems to fit, those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
 
[Verse 2]
          F                          Fmaj7
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun,
    F7                        Bb                 Am
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
  D7             Am   D7   Gm7                                              Bb
Sleepin' on the job, those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
 
[Bridge]
            C   F       Fmaj7
But there's one thing I know,
    Bb                 C              Am7
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
                      D7              Gm7            Bb/C C Bb/C C
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
 
[Verse 3]
F                            Fmaj7
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head,
    F7                             Bb              Am
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red,
D7              Am  D7    Gm7                                         Bb
Cryin's not for me, cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
  C          F     Gm7               F
Because I'm free, nothing's worryin' me
 
[Solo]

[Verse 4]
