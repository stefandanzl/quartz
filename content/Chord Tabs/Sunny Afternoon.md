[Verse]
 
     Dm             C7
The taxman's taken all my dough
     F              C7
And left me in my stately home
A      A/G   A/F  A/E   Dm
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
               C7
And I can't sail my yacht
       F          C7
He's taken everything I've got
A          A/G        A/F  A/E Dm
All I've got's this sunny afternoon
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                  D7                   G   G7
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
            C7                       F     A7
I got a big fat mama tryin' to break me
      Dm                G
And I love to live so pleasantly
 Dm                  G7   C
Live this life of luxury
F            A         Dm  Dm/C  Dm/B  Dm/Bb
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
         A       A/G  A/F  A/E
In a summertime
         Dm     Dm/C  Dm/B  Dm/Bb
In a summertime
         A       A/G  A/F  A/E
In a summertime
 
 
[Verse]
 
    Dm             C7
My girlfriend's run off with my car
     F              C7
And gone back to her ma and pa
A         A/G      A/F   A/E   Dm
Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
               C7
Now I'm sittin' here
       F          C7
Sippin' at my ice-cooled beer
A      A/G     A/F    A/E   Dm
Lazin' on this sunny afternoon
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                  D7                   G   G7
Help me, help me, help me sail away
            C7                       F     A7
Or give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
      Dm                G
And I love to live so pleasantly
 Dm                  G7   C
Live this life of luxury
F            A         Dm  Dm/C  Dm/B  Dm/Bb
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
         A       A/G  A/F  A/E
In a summertime
         Dm     Dm/C  Dm/B  Dm/Bb
In a summertime
         A       A/G  A/F  A/E
In a summertime
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                  D7                   G   G7
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
            C7                       F     A7
I got a big fat mama tryin' to break me
      Dm                G
And I love to live so pleasantly
 Dm                  G7   C
Live this life of luxury
F            A         Dm  Dm/C  Dm/B  Dm/Bb
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
