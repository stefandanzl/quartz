  C   Am     F            C
Moon River wider than a mile
       F               C        Dm     E
I'm crossing you in style someday

Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker
     Am             B7          Em         F  G
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
  C   Am       F              C
Two drifters off to see the world
           F             C       Dm   E
There's such a lot of world to see
        C C7       F     Fm       C
We're aft er the same rainbows end
F                          C
And waiting round the bend

My huckleberry friend, Moon River

And me.
